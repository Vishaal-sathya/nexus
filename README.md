## 🛠️ How It Works

Nexus operates on the GEM (Generator-Evaluator Model) architecture, inspired by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). It ensures reliable recommendations by:

1. **Generator:** Analyzing job market trends and generating skill suggestions.
2. **Evaluator:** Verifying results and filtering non-reliable information.

The system prevents hallucinations in the AI's responses by embedding only verified knowledge sources.

## 🌟 Impact

- **Growth:** Events, gamification, and mentorship drive skill development.
- **Time Efficiency:** AI-driven learning paths streamline the upskilling journey.
- **Networking:** Nexus connects students with peers, mentors, and industry experts.

## 🔬 Technology Stack
- **Backend:** Python, Selenium
- **AI:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Model
- **Communication:** WhatsApp API

## 📈 Future Scope
- Advanced mentorship programs.
- Real-time job and internship matching.
- Deeper skill gap analysis using AI.
